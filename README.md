 Game Show App demostrating OOP skills
# Overview
The app is a phrase guessing game. The player will have 5 lives to guess the phrase correctly. If a player get the guess wrong a heart will be taken away. After all 5 hearts are gone the game will end and the player will have a chance to play again using another randomly selected phrase. If the user gets the phrase correct before losing all hearts. The game will end with a congratulations!
# Exceeds Expectations
I have provided a 'keyup' event listener to the app.js file to allow the keyboard to be used for play.

I have changed the colors of the wrong and chosen classes to help players better understand if their guess was correct or wrong. I changed the show class to have a brighter blue as the color. I also changed the background color of the main-container class.
